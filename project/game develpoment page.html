<p class="text-center fs-3 bg-warning text-light mt-5">Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a game. It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is important to think about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.
A game developer could be a programmer, a sound designer, an artist, a designer or many other roles available in the industry.</p>

<p class="text-center fs-3 bg-warning text-light mt-4">Game Development can be undertaken by a large Game Development Studio or by a single individual. It can be as small or large as you like. As long as it lets the player interact with content and is able to manipulate the game’s elements, you can call it a ‘game’.</p>

<p class="text-center fs-3 bg-warning text-light mt-4">To get involved in the Game Development process, you do not need to write code. Artists may create and design assets, while a Developer might focus on programming a health bar. A Tester may get involved to see that the game works as expected.</p>

<p class="text-center fs-3 bg-warning text-light mt-4">To resolve problems that game frameworks had, tools like libGDX and OpenGL were developed. They helped game development to be a lot faster and easier, providing lots of pre-made functions and features. However, it was still hard to enter the industry or understand a framework for someone coming from a non-programmer background,
 a common case in the game development scene.</p>
 
<p class="text-center fs-3 bg-warning text-light mt-4">That was when game engines like Construct, Game Maker, Unity and Unreal were developed. Generally, an engine has everything that a framework had, but with a more friendly approach by using a graphic user interface (GUI) and helping with the graphic development of the game.
</p>

<p class="text-center fs-3 bg-warning text-light mt-4">In some cases, like Game Maker and Construct, the amount of pre-made functions are so big that people with no previous programming skills could build a game from scratch, really expanding the scene and making game development accessible for almost anyone.
